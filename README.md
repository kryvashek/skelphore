# Skelphore
Massive repeated HTTP(S) requests simplifier.

## Name
This project has autogenerated name, thanks to [This Word Does Not Exist](https://thisworddoesnotexist.com) project.
The word definition can be checked [here](https://l.thisworddoesnotexist.com/LdKm).

## Purpose
When developing applications which make requests to HTTP(S) services one usually should support using just a few endpoints. Repeat those requests building from scratch each time seems quite unoptimal - this is where Skelphore can be used. You can preconfigure usage of several needed endpoints and then reuse that configuration to avoid repeating the same actions in code again and again.

## Inside
Skelphore built atop the [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate, and simplifies its usage while partially concealing its API. Thus if more detailed access to requests building process is needed, consider using [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) itself instead (or any other comparatively-low-level crate).
